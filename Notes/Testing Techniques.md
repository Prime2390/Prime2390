<h2 id=1>Introduction</h2>
<h3>The choice of testing technique is dictated by a number of factors related to </h3>
<ul>
    <li>Documentation, law (formal factors)</li>
    <li>Software (Production Factors)</li>
    <li>Time, budget, resources (Design factors)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=2>Three main categories of techniques</h2>
<h3>The syllabus, on the other hand, gives us three main categories of techniques :
</h3>
<ul>
    <li> <h4>Black box techniques</h4>
<p>This technique is based on specifications, using knowledge about how an object should behave. This technique uses, among other things, requirement specifications, case descriptions and user stories.</p></li>
    <li><h4>White-box techniques</h4>
<p>This technique is based on code structure. The source code of the object is tested. </p></li>
    <li> <h4>Experience-based techniques</h4>
<p>The source on which tests are based is the knowledge, intuition and experience of the people conducting them.</p></li>
</ul>
