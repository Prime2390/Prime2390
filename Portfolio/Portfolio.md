# Web Application Testing

Web application testing is the process of verifying that a website or web-based application operates correctly, performs efficiently, and provides a positive user experience. Key areas include:

1. **Functional Testing**: Verifying features such as forms, buttons, links, and user workflows.
2. **Performance Testing**: Evaluating load times, response times, and stability under different loads.
3. **Usability Testing**: Ensuring the interface is intuitive and user-friendly.
4. **Compatibility Testing**: Checking compatibility across different browsers, devices, and operating systems.
5. **Security Testing**: Identifying vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, or unauthorized data access.
6. **Responsive Design Testing**: Validating the appearance and functionality on various screen sizes and devices.
7. **Accessibility Testing**: Ensuring the application complies with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

Comprehensive web application testing ensures reliability and high-quality experiences for end users.
