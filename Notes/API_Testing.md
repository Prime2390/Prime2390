# API Testing - What It Is, What to Test, and Useful Tools for Manual Testing

## What Is API Testing?
API testing involves evaluating the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of application programming interfaces (APIs). The primary goal is to ensure APIs meet functional expectations and integrate seamlessly with other components or systems. It focuses on:
- Verifying data exchange between systems.
- Ensuring compliance with specifications.
- Testing for edge cases and error handling.

## What Is Tested in API Testing?
1. **Functionality**:
   - Ensuring APIs return the expected response for valid requests.
   - Verifying endpoints and methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. **Data Validation**:
   - Testing the accuracy of data returned by the API.
   - Validating input parameters and response formats.
3. **Error Handling**:
   - Checking how APIs respond to invalid inputs or missing parameters (e.g., HTTP error codes like 400, 401, 404, 500).
4. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Verifying security mechanisms like OAuth, API keys, or JWT tokens.
5. **Performance**:
   - Measuring response times under different loads.
   - Ensuring APIs handle concurrent requests effectively.
6. **Integration**:
   - Ensuring APIs work correctly with other systems or services.
7. **Boundary Testing**:
   - Testing APIs with edge cases, such as maximum or minimum input sizes.

## What Tools Are Useful for Manual API Testing?
Several tools support manual API testing by providing features for sending requests, validating responses, and managing test scenarios:

### 1. **Request Simulation**:
   - **Postman** – User-friendly tool for crafting, sending, and validating API requests.
   - **Insomnia** – Simplified tool for HTTP and REST API testing.
   - **Swagger UI** – Useful for exploring and testing APIs based on OpenAPI specifications.

### 2. **Command-Line Tools**:
   - **cURL** – Command-line tool for sending HTTP requests and testing APIs.
   - **HTTPie** – Alternative command-line tool with more user-friendly output.

### 3. **Test Case Management**:
   - **Postman Collections** – For organizing and managing API test cases.
   - **TestRail**, **Zephyr**, **Xray** – For documenting and tracking API test cases.

### 4. **Data Validation and Mocking**:
   - **Mockoon**, **WireMock** – Tools for mocking API endpoints during testing.
   - **JSONLint**, **XML Validator** – For validating response formats like JSON or XML.

### 5. **Performance Testing**:
   - **JMeter** – For stress testing APIs and measuring performance.
   - **K6** – Modern performance testing tool for APIs.

### 6. **Security Testing**:
   - **OWASP ZAP**, **Burp Suite** – For identifying vulnerabilities in APIs.
   - **Postman Pre-request Scripts** – For automating authentication and encryption during testing.

### 7. **Debugging and Logging**:
   - **Fiddler**, **Charles Proxy** – Tools for capturing and analyzing API traffic.

API testing ensures that the backbone of an application—the communication between different services—is robust and reliable. By using the right tools and strategies, manual API testing can effectively identify issues before they impact the end user.
