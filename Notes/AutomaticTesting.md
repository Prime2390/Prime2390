# Automatic Testing - What It Is, What to Test, and Useful Tools

## What Is Automatic Testing?
Automatic testing involves using software tools to execute test cases, compare actual outcomes with expected results, and report any discrepancies. It is designed to save time, improve test accuracy, and ensure consistency across repetitive testing tasks.

## What Is Tested in Automatic Testing?
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Testing individual components or functions in isolation.
   - Validating the correctness of small units of code.
2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Testing interactions between integrated components or systems.
   - Ensuring data flows correctly between modules.
3. **Regression Testing**:
   - Re-executing existing test cases after changes to ensure no new bugs are introduced.
   - Validating previously functioning features.
4. **Functional Testing**:
   - Automating user scenarios to verify that features meet requirements.
5. **Performance Testing**:
   - Simulating load and stress conditions to evaluate system performance.
   - Measuring response times and resource usage under heavy traffic.
6. **API Testing**:
   - Automating HTTP requests to validate endpoints, data exchange, and responses.
7. **UI Testing**:
   - Testing graphical user interfaces for correctness and responsiveness.
   - Automating actions like clicks, typing, and navigation.
