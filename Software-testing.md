<h2 id=1>Objectives of testing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Assessing the work products (stakeholder requirements, user stories, design and code)
</li>
  <li>Checking that the requirements imposed on the project have been met</li>
  <li>Checking that the test subject is performing as expected
</li>
  <li>Detecting defects and failures</li>
  <li>Ensuring test subject quality</li>
  <li>Providing stakeholders with information on work progress and detected defects
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=2>The 7 cardinal commandments</h2>
<ol>
  <li><h3>Testing reveals faults, but cannot prove the absence of faults.
</h3><p>Software testing aims to detect defects so that they can be fixed before production implementation. At the same time, the testing process does not confirm that the software is completely free of defects.</p></li>
