<h3>This is testing without running the product code, done correctly it is effective and efficient because it allows defects and problems to be detected in the early phases of the lifecycle that could pose a problem in subsequent phases.

<h2 id= 1>Previw Process</h2>
<h3>t is a form of static testing, performed manually.
</h3>
<h4>Types of inspection include:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>insepration</li>
    <li>technical inspection</li>
    <li>inspection</li>
    <li>informal review</li>
</ul>

<h2 id=2>Work product review process</h2>
<h3>These are the five types of activities that can occur during a work review
</h3>

<ol type="I">
    <li>
        <h4>Planning</h4>
        <p>The scope of work that the review will cover is defined. The objectives of the review are defined.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Starting the review</h4>
        <p>As part of the start of the review, work products and materials are distributed to the participants.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Individual review</h4>
        <p>In this phase the review of the product takes place. A complete or partial review is carried out as part of this activity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Feedback and problem analysis </h4>
        <p>Participants report on defects and problems detected in the review.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Defect removal and report</h4>
        <p>A report on the defects detected is created in this step</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2 id=3>Types of review</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <h4>Informal review</h4>
        <p>A less formalised, often spontaneous review of documents or code to quickly find potential problems. It proceeds without a set structure.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Formal review</h4>
        <p>A meticulous review of documentation, following a formal process with set stages. This is usually required for highly critical projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Technical review</h4>
        <p>An analysis of the technical aspects of the documentation or code, carried out by people with technical expertise. Focuses on compliance with technical requirements and correctness of implementation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h4>Inspection</h4>
        <p>A formal review process involving a team of inspectors who look for defects, deviations from standards and logical errors. Inspection has well-defined stages and is very detailed.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
