# Functional Testing - What It Is, What to Test, and Useful Tools for Manual Testing

## What Are Functional Tests?
Functional testing evaluates an application's functionality to ensure it behaves as expected according to the requirements. The goal is to validate that every feature works correctly and meets user needs. It focuses on testing:
- Individual functions or modules.
- User workflows and scenarios.
- Data inputs, processing, and expected outputs.

## What Is Tested in Functional Testing?
1. **Core Features**:
   - Validation of key functionalities, such as login, registration, or payment processes.
2. **Input and Output**:
   - Ensuring the application correctly handles various data inputs and provides expected outputs.
3. **User Scenarios**:
   - Testing how users interact with the system, such as creating accounts or completing transactions.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Checking the application's response to invalid data, missing inputs, or edge cases.
5. **Integration**:
   - Verifying how different components of the system work together.
6. **API Testing**:
   - Ensuring APIs return correct data and handle requests effectively.

## What Tools Are Useful for Manual Functional Testing?
Manual functional testing can be supported by tools that help execute test cases, record results, and track issues:

### 1. **Test Case Management**:
   - **TestRail**, **Zephyr**, **Xray** – For creating, managing, and tracking test cases.
   - **Excel/Google Sheets** – Simple tools for smaller projects to document test cases and results.

### 2. **Bug Tracking and Reporting**:
   - **JIRA**, **Bugzilla**, **Trello** – For logging and tracking issues found during testing.

### 3. **API Testing**:
   - **Postman** – For manually testing APIs and verifying responses.
   - **cURL** – Command-line tool for testing API requests and responses.

### 4. **Data Validation**:
   - **SQL Clients** (e.g., DBeaver, MySQL Workbench) – To validate database entries and data integrity.

### 5. **Browser Testing**:
   - **Chrome DevTools**, **Firefox Developer Tools** – For inspecting web applications and troubleshooting issues.

### 6. **Screen Recording**:
   - **OBS Studio**, **ShareX** – To record testing sessions and capture bugs in action.

### 7. **Virtualization Tools**:
   - **VMware**, **VirtualBox** – For testing applications in different operating systems and environments.

### 8. **Task Automation (Supplementary)**:
   - **Sikuli**, **AutoIt** – For repetitive tasks that can aid manual functional testing.

Functional testing ensures the reliability and correctness of an application's features, making it a critical step in the software development lifecycle. When conducted systematically and supported by the right tools, it significantly enhances the overall quality of the product.
