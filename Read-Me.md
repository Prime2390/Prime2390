 <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Hey, my name is Dominik and Iâ€™m from Poland. I'm a student of computer science and I'm interested in the subject of software testing, so this profile is partly my path I've gone through and also a portfolio to enrich my person. On this profile, I will share my personal projects, as well as notes and thoughts that I hope will help others in the future.
