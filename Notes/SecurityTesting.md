# Security Testing - What It Is, What to Test, and Useful Tools

## What Is Security Testing?
Security testing evaluates the robustness of an application against potential threats and vulnerabilities. It ensures that sensitive data is protected and unauthorized access is prevented. The primary goal is to identify security gaps and validate compliance with security standards.

## What Is Tested in Security Testing?
1. **Authentication**:
   - Ensuring user credentials are securely handled and validated.
   - Testing multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
2. **Authorization**:
   - Verifying access controls and permissions for different user roles.
   - Ensuring restricted areas cannot be accessed without proper privileges.
3. **Data Protection**:
   - Validating encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.
   - Ensuring proper handling of sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, etc.
4. **Input Validation**:
   - Testing for SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other input-based attacks.
   - Verifying proper sanitization and validation of user inputs.
5. **Session Management**:
   - Checking the security of session tokens and cookies.
   - Testing for vulnerabilities like session hijacking or fixation.
6. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensuring error messages do not expose sensitive information.
7. **Network Security**:
   - Testing for secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSL/TLS).
   - Ensuring APIs and endpoints are protected against unauthorized access.
8. **Compliance**:
   - Verifying adherence to industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

## Tools Useful for Security Testing
1. **Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - OWASP ZAP, Nessus
2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Burp Suite, Metasploit
3. **Password Testing**:
   - Hashcat, John the Ripper
4. **Encryption Validation**:
   - OpenSSL, CryptoTool
5. **Network Security Testing**:
   - Wireshark, Nmap
6. **Web Application Security**:
   - Acunetix, Netsparker
7. **API Security Testing**:
   - Postman (with security scripts), Insomnia
8. **Compliance Checking**:
   - Qualys Compliance Suite, SecurityMetrics
